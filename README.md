## What I Do

#### My programming journey has led me to work in various roles and across diverse industries. I've been a part of teams, leading some, and even sailing solo on numerous occasions. This journey has imbued me with a deep understanding of development, testing, and deployment processes.

##### 🛠 **Technologies**: My toolset includes Yii2, Craft CMS, DDEV, MySQL, Redis, Amazon Web Services, Vue.js, Symfony, React.js, Docker, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Laravel, HumHub, and a few others. From Frontend to Backend, and the nitty-gritty of DevOps, I've got you covered!

##### 👥 **Teams**: From Team Lead guiding a team of 9 developers, to working as a Full Stack Developer, I've experienced the dynamics of both large and small teams. My focus is always on delivering quality while nurturing healthy team synergy.

##### 🌐 **Cloud**: I have hands-on experience with leading cloud platforms like Digital Ocean and AWS. From hosting scalable web apps to managing resources, I can help you get the most out of the cloud.

##### 🔁 **Automation**: I'm a strong advocate for automation as a means of boosting efficiency and reducing errors. Whether it's setting up a CI/CD pipeline, writing unit tests, or automated deployments, you can count on me!

### Learning & Sharing

I believe in lifelong learning and sharing knowledge. It's not only about acquiring online certifications (check them out on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/t4l3x)) or winning awards (like placing second at Millinet). I've also had the privilege of teaching interns and students, preparing the next generation of developers.
